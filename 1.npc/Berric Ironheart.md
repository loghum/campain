Master Berric Ironheart is a rugged, weathered man with a powerful build, his face etched with scars and age lines. His short, graying hair and intense blue eyes reflect his years of battle experience. He wears simple, well-worn leather armor and carries a greatsword, _Sunder_, with practiced ease.
