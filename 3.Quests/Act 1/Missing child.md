Berric stormt de klas lokaal binnen. Team groen, kom met mij mee. In de hal staat vrouw. jaar 35. simpele kleren. Boer. "Ik was even afgeleid en toen verloor ik mijn 8 jarige dochter, Lila uit het oog. Ze is een echte ontdekking reiziger, maar is nog nooit zo ver gegaan. Ze ging richting de oude molen. Ze zeggen dat het daar spookt. Ze zeggen dat je ze kan horen lachen."

A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals small footprints and a torn piece of Lila’s red scarf snagged on a bush.

As the party ventures closer to the mill, the forest grows unnaturally still. Strange whispers fill the air, and illusory lights lead the adventurers astray unless they pass a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check to ignore the distractions.



Optional Combat: A band of small, capering sprites (3-4 Pixies) appears, warning the party to leave. The sprites don’t want to harm Lila but will attempt to deter the party with pranks or non-lethal magic like Entangle and Sleep.
The Fey Court (Abandoned Mill)

```encounter
creatures:
  - 3: Pixie
  - 
```



 The old mill is overgrown with moss and vines, and the inside has been transformed into a whimsical, otherworldly court. The air smells sweet, and tiny fey creatures flit about, watching the party with curious eyes.
Lila is sitting on a large toadstool, giggling as a Quickling performs a wild dance. The fey creatures, led by a Grig (or Satyr, if you prefer), have taken Lila in to play and mean her no harm. They see her as a “guest.”
Diplomacy or Trickery

```encounter
creatures:
  - Quickling
  - Satyr
  - 3: Pixie
```

The party must negotiate with the fey to return Lila safely. The fey demand a trade:
A Fun Exchange: The adventurers must entertain the court with a riddle contest, music, or a daring display.
A Fair Deal: Offer something shiny or rare, like a gemstone, magical trinket, or even a secret (e.g., the party’s greatest fear).
Combat Option: If the party is hostile or refuses to bargain, the fey creatures defend Lila and the mill (Quickling and Grig supported by 2-3 Sprites).
Conclusion
If successful, the adventurers return Lila to her grateful parent. They may receive:
Reward: A few gold coins, homemade goods, or minor magical items like a Potion of Healing.
Reputation: The town sees the adventurers as heroes, opening future quest opportunities.
Twist Opportunity: The fey might leave a parting gift (or curse!) on one of the adventurers for their behavior.
