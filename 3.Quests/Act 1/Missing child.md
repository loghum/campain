Option 1: The Missing Child
Hook
The adventurers are approached by a distraught parent, begging for help to find their missing child. The child, a curious 8-year-old named Lila, wandered off while playing near the edge of the forest. The parent last saw Lila heading toward an old, abandoned mill, and they fear something terrible has happened.

Details
Location: An abandoned mill nestled at the edge of a dense forest.
Timeframe: Lila disappeared earlier that day, and the trail is still fresh.
Villager Insights:
Parent: “She loves exploring near the forest, but she’s never gone this far before. Please, bring her back safely!”
Neighbor: “Kids go missing near that mill sometimes. Folks say it’s cursed.”
Woodcutter: “Strange lights and laughter at night... could be fey.”
Encounters
Trail of Clues

Skill Checks: A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals small footprints and a torn piece of Lila’s red scarf snagged on a bush.
Obstacles: A swarm of mischievous ravens (2-3 Giant Ravens, homebrew or similar to Giant Owls) swoop down to scatter the trail and harass the party.
The Enchanted Forest

As the party ventures closer to the mill, the forest grows unnaturally still. Strange whispers fill the air, and illusory lights lead the adventurers astray unless they pass a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check to ignore the distractions.
Optional Combat: A band of small, capering sprites (3-4 Pixies) appears, warning the party to leave. The sprites don’t want to harm Lila but will attempt to deter the party with pranks or non-lethal magic like Entangle and Sleep.
The Fey Court (Abandoned Mill)

Setting: The old mill is overgrown with moss and vines, and the inside has been transformed into a whimsical, otherworldly court. The air smells sweet, and tiny fey creatures flit about, watching the party with curious eyes.
Lila is sitting on a large toadstool, giggling as a Quickling performs a wild dance. The fey creatures, led by a Grig (or Satyr, if you prefer), have taken Lila in to play and mean her no harm. They see her as a “guest.”
Diplomacy or Trickery

The party must negotiate with the fey to return Lila safely. The fey demand a trade:
A Fun Exchange: The adventurers must entertain the court with a riddle contest, music, or a daring display.
A Fair Deal: Offer something shiny or rare, like a gemstone, magical trinket, or even a secret (e.g., the party’s greatest fear).
Combat Option: If the party is hostile or refuses to bargain, the fey creatures defend Lila and the mill (Quickling and Grig supported by 2-3 Sprites).
Conclusion
If successful, the adventurers return Lila to her grateful parent. They may receive:
Reward: A few gold coins, homemade goods, or minor magical items like a Potion of Healing.
Reputation: The town sees the adventurers as heroes, opening future quest opportunities.
Twist Opportunity: The fey might leave a parting gift (or curse!) on one of the adventurers for their behavior.
