Hook
The local baker, Hilda Hearthstone, claims her late spouse’s spirit has begun haunting the bakery. Items are moving on their own, baked goods are being ruined, and strange noises are heard at night. Hilda is desperate and asks the adventurers to investigate, offering free bread and pastries for a month as payment.

Setting
Location: Hilda’s bakery is a cozy, warm building in the town’s center, with shelves of bread, pies, and pastries. At night, the atmosphere shifts; the air feels heavy, and faint whispers can be heard.
Backstory: Hilda’s late spouse, Borin, passed away last year. Their favorite trinket, a small silver locket, was accidentally sold to a traveling merchant. This caused a restless spirit (or something else) to appear.
Clues
Ruined Goods:

Burned bread, overturned mixing bowls, and spilled flour are everywhere.
Investigation reveals no human footprints, but faint claw-like marks.
Witnesses:

A young delivery boy reports seeing glowing blue lights in the bakery at night.
A neighbor swears they heard laughter and the sound of something being knocked over.
Hilda’s Memories:

Hilda reveals Borin was deeply attached to a locket, believing it brought them luck. She fears their spirit may be upset after its loss.
Encounters
Nighttime Investigation:

If the party stakes out the bakery overnight, strange phenomena occur:
Poltergeist Activity: Chairs slide across the floor, pans fly through the air, and a ghostly laugh echoes. The adventurers must make DC 13 Dexterity saving throws to avoid minor injuries (1d4 damage).
Glimpses of the Spirit: A translucent figure appears briefly, pointing toward the cellar.
Cellar Confrontation:

In the bakery’s cellar, the party encounters the source of the disturbances:
Option A: Poltergeist (Undead): Borin’s restless spirit is manifesting, angry about the missing locket.
Option B: Imp (Fiend): A rival baker summoned a mischievous imp to sabotage Hilda’s business. The imp has been posing as Borin’s ghost.
Combat or Diplomacy: The party must either defeat the entity or appease it by promising to recover the locket.
The Missing Locket:

The party learns the locket was sold to a merchant who frequents a nearby village. They must track down and retrieve it, offering either gold or a favor in return.
Conclusion
Resolution with the Spirit:

If the locket is returned, Borin’s spirit fades peacefully, leaving behind a sense of warmth in the bakery.
Hilda rewards the adventurers with:
Free food and pastries for a month.
A small pouch of gold (10–20 gp).
A magical trinket, such as a Cookie of Fortitude (grants temporary HP).
Sabotage Revealed:

If the imp was the culprit, exposing the rival baker could lead to:
Rivalry between the bakers escalating into a town feud.
The party gaining a grateful ally in Hilda.
Twists
The Spirit's True Nature: Borin’s spirit could reveal a deeper secret, like knowledge of a hidden treasure or an unresolved town mystery.
Double Sabotage: Both the ghost and the imp could be involved, forcing the adventurers to balance solving two problems at once.
The Locket’s Curse: The locket itself could be cursed, causing Borin’s spirit to linger even after it’s returned.
