 ### **Villain: Karlek Duskveil, the Soulbinder**

**Race:** Half-Elf  
**Class:** Warlock (Great Old One Patron)  
**Background:** Acolyte  
**Alignment:** Neutral Evil

#### **Motivation:**

Karlek is attempting to complete a ritual to bind the souls of an entire town into a magical crystal, which he plans to use as a bargaining tool to ascend to greater power under his mysterious patron.

#### **Personality and Traits:**

- **Personality:** Cold, calculating, and theatrical. Karlek views himself as an artist, with his ritual as the ultimate masterpiece.
- **Flaw:** Overconfidence. He believes his patron's blessing makes him invincible.
- **Quirk:** Speaks in flowery, almost poetic language when addressing the party.

#### **Ritual Details:**

Karlek has anchored the ritual to the town square. A black obelisk hums with dark energy, surrounded by glowing runes that siphon the life essence from the townsfolk. Completing the ritual requires three hours of uninterrupted casting, and Karlek is nearly halfway through when the party arrives.

**Race:** Human  
**Class:** Fighter (Champion)

- **Crimsonroot:** A blood-red herb that amplifies life-draining magic.
